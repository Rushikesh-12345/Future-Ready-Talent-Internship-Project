I have created a food-related helpful website named Foodie Blog using HTML, CSS, and Javascript it helps the visitors to find particular helpful information on the website. I make three pages named home, about, and contact its looks like a professional website. am trying to solve real-world problems like these days we are searching for a good and genuine food dishes information here. So I make a web app that tries to give every food detail. My project helps the customer. I create a very beautiful User design that attracts visitors easily and also helps to get the food-related information on their mobile in one click and less time.
